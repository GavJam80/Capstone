## UX

The site experience is designed to provide the user with an informative and straightforward tour of the club. In this instance the design is based on a martial arts club but with very little adaptation it can become a template for any small hobbyist outfit like an archery club, bowling dance etc.

<h2><ins>Colour scheme</ins></h2>

The colour scheme is designed around traditional martial arts colours:

#B81818 CORNELL RED

#FFFFFF WHITE

#000000 BLACK

#445261 CHARCOL

## Lighthouse

Lighthouse testing revealved more could be done, the main isuues were third party cookies and Cloudinary, alternatives will be considered for the 2nd iteration

![Screenshot 2025-01-28 082216](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0a23133-f8a8-46d6-a7e4-0d59ebf4859b)


## Deployment

The site is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

Once you have an account you will have to create a new app and select your closest continent (USA, EUROPE).

You will need to setup your Config Vars as they are unique:

* CLOUDINARY_URL
* DATABASE_URL
* SECRET_KEY

You can automatically or manually deply deploy from the Heroku site
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca13a55-2bab-4dc6-9b15-a5b80c8f8b1c)


Additional files within your project will be required:

* requirements.txt
* Procfile
* runtime.txt
* env.py

Project requirements can be installed in Your preferred IDE, in VS you can use
* pip3 install -r requirements.txt

You will need to add your python version to the runtime file.
* python3 --version  

Any packages you use will need to be added to the requirements file:
* pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt


The Procfile (note the capital 'P') can be created in the console:
* echo web: gunicorn (your_app_name).wsgi > Procfile

The PostgreSQL database is supplied by Code Institute so cannot be directly forked<br>

As a CI student  requested a database through the link in the LMS, the link was emailed to me, as a non CI student you will not be able to do this and will need to setup your own database. Databased are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To copy (clone) this project to your computer:

* Go to the GitHub page: Visit the project's page on GitHub [Template](https://github.com/GavJam80/Capstone).

* Copy the code: Click the green "Code" button, choose how you want to copy (usually HTTPS is easiest), and click the copy icon.

* Open your terminal: Open either Git Bash (if you have it) or your computer's regular terminal.

* Choose where to save:  Use the cd command in your terminal to go to the folder where you want the project to be saved.  For example, cd Documents/Projects.

* Clone: In your terminal, paste the copied link after the command git clone. It should look like this: git clone https://github.com/GavJam80/Capstone.git

* Press Enter:  This will download the project to your computer.

You will need an env.py file to hide your secret keys and sensitive data from GitHub and Heroku, This step is very important! it will hide data such as
* cloudinary connection info, name, api, secret etc.
* database key, url
*  local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
           os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")


Once you have forked or cloned the project there a few steps to runnig it locally:

* Start the Djanjo app with: 'python3 manage.py runserver' 
* It can be stoped with 'ctrl+c or command+c'
* Make migrations: 'python3 manage.py makemigrations'
* Migrate: 'python3 manage.py migrate'
* Create your superuser account: 'python3 manage.py createsuperuser'


Images subject to long term deployment are hosted on Cloudinary as Heroku does't provide indefinate storing of imagery. A guide to setting up with Cloudinart can be found [HERE](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free)


## AI Implementation and Orchestration

* Code Creation - using copilot to assist in simple tasks for speedy development

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c77a2f-94e8-4879-a542-b91c17cd42f4)


* Debugging - using copilot to assist with checks

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91227b5c-ae7c-44ac-8724-8b92e8d605b4)

* Performance and UX Optimization

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f30c96c-3c7a-4000-b77e-1d723fbee704)

* Automated unit testing

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd161b50-2ae5-48a3-b84e-7ff0e0b7e79c)

* Overall impact
Using copilot to complete monotonous tasks if a great help, the autocomplete must be thoroughly considered though as it is far from perfect. It can be very usefull when you have left a stray bracket or have a superfluous tag by saving time looking for oversights and human error.

## Future Features

I did make an AI quizbot limited to a multiple choice Q & A but the requirements file was nearly tripled and the secret key needed to be updated every 3 days which meant it was not suitable for assessment as it would havevery quickly become a broken feature. For the next iteration I would like to add it and find a more permanant solution as it was a very good learnig tool and can be setup so as to only respond to fixed subject matter.
